**Horizons of Human Potential: Navigating the Future of Growth and Innovation.**
--title generated by chatGPT--

**Overview**

As a kid I was fascinated with the book The Directory of Possibilities by Colin Wilson and John Grant. I always wanted an up to date version, but none came out. Not that I'm clever enough to put all this together by myself, I thought what could chatGPT do for me? Here is the book in a github repository.

The goal is to create a readable, believable book purely using the chaGPT 4o-mini LLM. I'll expand and do the same for the larger model. 

**Heres how I did it**
I paid for a monthly $20 personal subscription to chatGPT.
I asked it the following question:
> can you write a modern day version of the book "The Directory of Possibilities" written by Colin Wilson?
